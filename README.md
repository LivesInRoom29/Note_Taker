# Note Taker
[![License: Unlicense](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Unlicense-blue.svg)](http://unlicense.org/)

## Description
An application that allows the user to write, save, view, and delete notes. It is meant to help one keep track of things that need to be done and other important information so that it doesn't get forgotten, or lost on a random piece of paper.

For this project, the frontend was already created. My task was to build the backend and connect it to the frontend.

**Built With:**
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
* [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)
* [UUID](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid)
* [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
